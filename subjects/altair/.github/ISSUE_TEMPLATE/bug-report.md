Please follow these steps to make it more efficient to solve your issue:

- [ ] Since Altair is a Python wrapper around the Vega-Lite visualization grammar, [most bugs should be reported directly to Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues). You can click the Action Button of your Altair chart and "Open in Vega Editor" to create a reproducible Vega-Lite example and see if you get the same error in the Vega Editor.
- [ ] Search for duplicate issues.
- [ ] Use the latest version of Altair.
- [ ] Describe how to reproduce the bug and include the full code and data to reproduce it, ideally using a sample data set from `vega_datasets`.
