# Contributors

pypdf had a lot of contributors since it started with pyPdf in 2005. We are
a free software project without any company affiliation. We cannot pay
contributors, but we do value their contributions. A lot of time, effort, and
expertise went into this project. With this list, we recognize those awesome
people ü§ó

The list is definitely not complete. You can find more contributors via the git
history and [GitHubs 'Contributors' feature](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/graphs/contributors).

## Adding a new contributor

Contributors are:

* Anybody who has an commit in main - no matter how big/small or how many. Also if it's via co-authored-by.
* People who opened helpful issues:
  (1) Bugs: with complete MCVE
  (2) Well-described feature requests
  (3) Potentially some more.
  The maintainers of pypdf have the last call on that one.
* Community work: This is exceptional. If the maintainers of pypdf see people
  being super helpful in answering issues / discussions or being very active on
  Stackoverflow, we also consider them being contributors to pypdf.
