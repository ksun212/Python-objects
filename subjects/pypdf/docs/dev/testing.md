# Testing

pypdf uses [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) for testing.

## De-selecting groups of tests

pypdf makes use of the following pytest markers:

* `slow`: Tests that require more than 5 seconds
* `samples`: Tests that require the [the `sample-files` git submodule](https://github.com/py-pdf/sample-files) to be initialized. As of October 2022, this is about 25 MB.
* `enable_socket`: Tests that download PDF documents. They are stored locally and thus only need to be downloaded once. As of October 2022, this is about 200 MB.

You can disable them by `pytest -m "not enable_socket"` or `pytest -m "not samples"`.
You can even disable all of them: `pytest -m "not enable_socket" -m "not samples" -m "not slow"`.

Please note that this reduces test coverage. The CI will always test all files.

## Creating a Coverage Report

If you want to get a coverage report that considers the Python version specific
code, you can run [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/).

As a prerequisite, we recommend using [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
so that you can install the different Python versions:

```
pyenv install pypy3.8-7.3.7
pyenv install 3.6.15
pyenv install 3.7.12
pyenv install 3.8.12
pyenv install 3.9.10
pyenv install 3.10.2
```

Then you can execute `tox` which will create a coverage report in HTML form
in the end. The execution takes about 30 minutes.
